## How was Arwit deployed on Arweave permaweb
Arwit application was uploaded to the Arweave permaweb using [Ardrive](https://ardrive.io/), providing a convenient and efficient way to store and manage data on the Arweave network and [ArNS](https://ar.io/arns/) was used to create a subdomain `arwit-cert-issuer` for hosting the [Arwit](https://arwit-cert-issuer.arweave.dev/) project.
